Here's guides on how to deploy Astro projects using Domain Expansion to different providers:

## Vercel

It just works.

## Netlify

It just works.

## @astrojs/node (without Docker)

It just works.

## Docker (Coolify etc.)

In Docker, we recommend using [cache mounts](https://docs.docker.com/build/cache/optimize/#use-cache-mounts). Here's how to use them within a `Dockerfile`:

```Dockerfile
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/app/node_modules/.domain-expansion npm run build
```

Other than that, <br />
**It just works.**
