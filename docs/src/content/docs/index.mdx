import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Domain Expansion is an Astro integration that adds support for incremental builds.

## Installation

The Domain Expansion integration can be installed from npm using the following command:

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="npm">
		```bash
		npx astro add @domain-expansion/astro
		```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="pnpm">
		```bash
		pnpm astro add @domain-expansion/astro
		```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="yarn">
		```bash
		yarn astro add @domain-expansion/astro
		```
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will install the integration and add it to your `astro.config.mjs`.

## Usage

Once the integration has been included in your `astro.config.mjs`, the next time you build your site,
your build will be cached. From that point on, whenever you rebuild your site, only the files that have
changed will be rebuilt.
