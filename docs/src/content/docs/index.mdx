description: And they said incremental builds in Astro weren't possible.

Domain Expansion is an Astro integration that adds support for incremental builds. Basically,
builds go weee now.

## Benchmarks

Here's how Domain Expansion performs against the default Astro build, both in a cold and hot build scenario.

<BenchmarkResults />

You can read more about the benchmarks in the [benchmarks README](https://github.com/astro-expansion/domain-expansion/tree/main/benchmarks)
on our GitHub repository.

Basically - the bigger the site, the more you'll see Domain Expansion shine. You can read more about the
trade-offs on the [caveats page](/caveats).

## Installation

The Domain Expansion integration can be installed from npm using the following command:

<Tabs>
	  <TabItem label="npm">

    	```bash
    	npx astro add @domain-expansion/astro
    	```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="pnpm">

    	```bash
    	pnpm astro add @domain-expansion/astro
    	```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="yarn">

    	```bash
    	yarn astro add @domain-expansion/astro
    	```
    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

This will install the integration and add it to your `astro.config.mjs`.

### Manual Installation

Install the `@domain-expansion/astro` package using your package manager of choice:

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="npm">

    	```bash
    	npm i @domain-expansion/astro
    	```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="pnpm">

    	```bash
    	pnpm add @domain-expansion/astro
    	```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="yarn">

    	```bash
    	yarn add @domain-expansion/astro
    	```
    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

Import and use the integration in your `astro.config.mjs`:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import domainExpansion from '@domain-expansion/astro';

export default defineConfig({
	integrations: [domainExpansion()],
});
```

## Usage

Once the integration has been included in your `astro.config.mjs`, the next time you build your site,
your build will be cached. From that point on, whenever you rebuild your site, only the files that have
changed will be rebuilt.

### When to use

Use this when you have big, and we mean **BIG** Astro sites. You'll see diminishing returns on smaller sites.

### Even more optimization

Pray that [Rolldown](https://rolldown.rs/) gets released soon. It's current version, Rollup,
accounts for about 90% of the build time for subsequent builds.
