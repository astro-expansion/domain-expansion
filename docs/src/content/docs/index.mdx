Domain Expansion is an Astro integration that adds support for incremental builds.

## Installation

The Domain Expansion integration can be installed from npm using the following command:

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="npm">
		```bash
		npx astro add @domain-expansion/astro
		```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="pnpm">
		```bash
		pnpm astro add @domain-expansion/astro
		```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="yarn">
		```bash
		yarn astro add @domain-expansion/astro
		```
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will install the integration and add it to your `astro.config.mjs`.

### Manual Installation

Install the `@domain-expansion/astro` package using your package manager of choice:

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="npm">
		```bash
		npm i @domain-expansion/astro
		```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="pnpm">
		```bash
		pnpm add @domain-expansion/astro
		```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="yarn">
		```bash
		yarn add @domain-expansion/astro
		```
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Import and use the integration in your `astro.config.mjs`:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import domainExpansion from "@domain-expansion/astro";

export default defineConfig({
	integrations: [
		domainExpansion(),
	],
});
```

## Usage

Once the integration has been included in your `astro.config.mjs`, the next time you build your site,
your build will be cached. From that point on, whenever you rebuild your site, only the files that have
changed will be rebuilt.
