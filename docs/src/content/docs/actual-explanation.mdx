title: An actual explanation of what is going on here
---

After reading the Tale of the Three Mages, you might be a little confused, so here's an actual explanation of how 
Domain Expansion works under the hood.

## How Astro builds your site

Whenever you run `astro build`, Astro will essentially "request" your components internally and save the 
resulting HTML. This happens with two functions, `$$render` and `$$renderComponent`. The first one is used to render 
the whole component, while the latter is used to render nested components. You can see the output of these 
functions on [the live Astro compiler](https://live-astro-compiler.vercel.app/). The output of a component from the compiler 
will look somewhat like this:

```ts
import {
  Fragment,
  render as $$render,
  createAstro as $$createAstro,
  createComponent as $$createComponent,
  renderComponent as $$renderComponent,
  renderHead as $$renderHead,
  maybeRenderHead as $$maybeRenderHead,
  unescapeHTML as $$unescapeHTML,
  renderSlot as $$renderSlot,
  mergeSlots as $$mergeSlots,
  addAttribute as $$addAttribute,
  spreadAttributes as $$spreadAttributes,
  defineStyleVars as $$defineStyleVars,
  defineScriptVars as $$defineScriptVars,
  renderTransition as $$renderTransition,
  createTransitionScope as $$createTransitionScope,
  renderScript as $$renderScript,
  
} from "astro/runtime/server/index.js";
import Foo from './Foo.astro';
import Bar from './Bar.astro';

const $$stdin = $$createComponent(($$result, $$props, $$slots) => {

return $$render`${$$maybeRenderHead($$result)}<div>
    ${$$renderComponent($$result,'Foo',Foo,{},{"default": () => $$render`
        Domain Expansion
    `,})}
    ${$$renderComponent($$result,'Bar',Bar,{"baz":"tizio"})}
</div>`;
}, '<stdin>', undefined);
export default $$stdin;

```

You can see how the `$$renderComponent` template tag is used to render the components `Foo` and `Bar`,
while the `$$render` template tag is used to render the whole component or children of components which
themselves do not contain any further child components.

## Intercepting the build process

When you install Domain Expansion and add the integration, it adds a Vite plugin. This plugin essentially
just replaces the `$$render` and `$$renderComponent` functions with its own versions. The new `$$render` 
function checks the cache based on a hash of the component which is calling `$$render`. If the hash is the
same as the one in the cache, we can be sure that the content hasn't changed, so we can just return the cached
content. If the hash is different, we need to render the content again and save it to the cache.

The `$$renderComponent` function works in a similar way, although there are two different scenarios here.

First, if the component has no children (it is self-closing, like this: `<Foo />`), we compute the hash
based on the name of the component and the props. If neither changed, we can return the cached content, if not,
we simply re-render it.

Second, if the component has children, we also include the hash of the parent component, which then gets
included in the hash along with the component name and its props. Again, if the hash is the same, we can
return the cached content, if not, we render the component and save it to the cache.

The cache is saved in `node_modules/.domain-expansion`.
